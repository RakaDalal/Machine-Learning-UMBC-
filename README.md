# Machine-Learning-UMBC-
These are solutions written by me to two different assignments in Machine Learning taught by Dr Tim Oates at UMBC. In the first assignment, I have implemented CNN with TensorFlow over the CIFAR-10 dataset. In the second assignement, I implemented Q-Learning from scratch in Python.
